"Donald J. Trump (2nd Term)","Thank you Thank you very much everybody Applause Wow Thank you very very much Vice President Vance Speaker Johnson Senator Thune Chief Justice Roberts Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States President Clinton President Bush President Obama President Biden Vice President Harris and my fellow citizens The golden age of America begins right now From this day forward our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world We will be the envy of every nation and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer During every single day of the Trump administration I will very simply put America first Our sovereignty will be reclaimed Our safety will be restored The scales of justice will be rebalanced The vicious violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud prosperous and free America will soon be greater stronger and far more exceptional than ever before I return to the Presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success A tide of change is sweeping the country sunlight is pouring over the entire world and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before But first we must be honest about the challenges we face While they are plentiful they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America As we gather today our Government confronts a crisis of trust For many years a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair We now have a Government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad It fails to protect our magnificent law abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world We have a Government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or more importantly its own people Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina who have been treated so badly and other States who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or more recently Los Angeles where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense They re raging through the houses and communities even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country some of whom are sitting here right now They don t have a home any longer That s interesting But we can t let this happen Everyone is unable to do anything about it That s going to change We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves in many cases to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them All of this will change starting today and it will change very quickly My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith their wealth their democracy and indeed their freedom From this moment on America s decline is over Our liberties and our Nation s glorious destiny will no longer be denied And we will immediately restore the integrity competency and loyalty of America s Government Over the past years I have been tested and challenged more than any President in our year history and I ve learned a lot along the way The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one that I can tell you Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life Just a few months ago in a beautiful Pennsylvania field an assassin s bullet ripped through my ear But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason I was saved by God to make America great again Applause Thank you Thank you Thank you very much That is why each day under our administration of American patriots we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope prosperity safety and peace for citizens of every race religion color and creed For American citizens January is liberation day It is my hope that our recent Presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country As our victory showed the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society young and old men and women African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans urban suburban rural And very importantly we had a powerful win in all seven swing States applause and the popular vote we won by millions of people To the Black and Hispanic communities I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote We set records and I will not forget it I ve heard your voices in the campaign and I look forward to working with you in the years to come Today is Martin Luther King Day And his honor this will be a great honor But in his honor we will strive together to make his dream a reality We will make his dream come true Applause Thank you Thank you Thank you National unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring like never before In everything we do my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success We will not forget our country we will not forget our Constitution and we will not forget our God Applause Can t do that Today I will sign a series of historic Executive orders With these actions we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense It s all about common sense First I will declare a national emergency at our southern border All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy I will end the practice of catch and release And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country Under the orders I sign today we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of I will direct our Government to use the full and immense power of Federal and State law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U S soil including our cities and inner cities As Commander in Chief I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions and that is exactly what I am going to do We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before Next I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency We will drill baby drill America will be a manufacturing nation once again and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth and we are going to use it We ll use it We will bring prices down fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top and export American energy all over the world We will be a rich nation again and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it With my actions today we will end the green new deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers In other words you ll be able to buy the car of your choice We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago And thank you to the autoworkers of our Nation for your inspiring vote of confidence We did tremendously with their vote I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens For this purpose we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs duties and revenues It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury coming from foreign sources The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before To restore competence and effectiveness to our Federal Government my administration will establish the brandnew Department of Government Efficiency After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional Federal efforts to restrict free expression I also will sign an Executive order to immediately stop all Government censorship and bring back free speech to America Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents something I know something about Laughter We will not allow that to happen It will not happen again Under my leadership we will restore fair equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities This week I will also end the Government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based As of today it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders male and female This week I will reinstate any servicemembers who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full backpay And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty It s going to end immediately Our Armed Forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission defeating America s enemies Like in we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end and perhaps most importantly the wars we never get into My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier That s what I want to be a peacemaker and a unifier I m pleased to say that as of yesterday day before I assumed office the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families Applause Thank you America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest most powerful most respected nation on Earth inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world A short time from now we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and we will restore the name of a great President William McKinley to Mount McKinley where it should be and where it belongs President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent he was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did including the Panama Canal which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States the United States I mean think of this spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost lives in the building of the Panama Canal We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama s promise to us has been broken The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way shape or form And that includes the United States Navy And above all China is operating the Panama Canal And we didn t give it to China We gave it to Panama and we re taking it back Above all my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage vigor and the vitality of history s greatest civilization So as we liberate our Nation we will lead it to new heights of victory and success We will not be deterred Together we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe healthy and disease free The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation one that increases our wealth expands our territory builds our cities raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation and right now our Nation is more ambitious than any other There s no nation like our Nation Americans are explorers builders innovators entrepreneurs and pioneers The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth No one comes close Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness They crossed deserts scaled mountains braved untold dangers won the Wild West ended slavery rescued millions from tyranny lifted billions from poverty harnessed electricity split the atom launched mankind into the heavens and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand If we work together there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback But as you see today here I am The American people have spoken I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do In America the impossible is what we do best From New York to Los Angeles from Philadelphia to Phoenix from Chicago to Miami from Houston to right here in Washington DC our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom They were farmers and soldiers cowboys and factory workers steelworkers and coal miners police officers and pioneers who pushed onward marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride Together they laid down the railroads raised up the skyscrapers built great highways won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced After all we have been through together we stand on the verge of the greatest years in American history With your help we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love and we love it so much We are one people one family and one glorious nation under God So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future I am with you I will fight for you and I will win for you We re going to win like never before Applause Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you In recent years our Nation has suffered greatly But we are going to bring it back and make it great again greater than ever before We will be a nation like no other full of compassion courage and exceptionalism Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry violent and totally unpredictable America will be respected again and admired again including by people of religion faith and good will We will be prosperous we will be proud we will be strong and we will win like never before We will not be conquered we will not be intimidated we will not be broken and we will not fail From this day on the United States of America will be a free sovereign and independent nation We will stand bravely we will live proudly we will dream boldly and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans The future is ours and our golden age has just begun Thank you God bless America Thank you all Thank you Thank you very much Thank you very much Thank you Thank you",2025,"republican",1
"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.","Chief Justice Roberts Vice President Harris Speaker Pelosi Leader Schumer Leader McConnell Vice President Pence and my distinguished guests and my fellow Americans This is America s day This is democracy s day a day of history and hope of renewal and resolve Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause the cause of democracy The people the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded We ve learned again that democracy is precious democracy is fragile And at this hour my friends democracy has prevailed So now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol s very foundation we come together as one Nation under God indivisible to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries As we look ahead in our uniquely American way restless bold optimistic and set our sights on the Nation we know we can be and we must be I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today I thank them from the bottom of my heart And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength the strength of our Nation as does President Carter who I spoke with last night who cannot be with us today but whom we salute for his lifetime of service I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots have taken the oath first sworn by George Washington But the American story depends not on any one of us not on some of us but on all of us on We the People who seek a more perfect Union This is a great Nation we are good people Over the centuries through storm and strife in peace and in war we ve come so far But we still have far to go We ll press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities much to repair much to restore much to heal much to build and much to gain Few people in our Nation s history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we re in now A once in a century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II Millions of jobs have been lost hundreds of thousands of businesses closed A cry for racial justice some years in the making moves us The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer A cry for survival comes from the planet itself a cry that can t be any more desperate or any more clear And now a rise of political extremism White supremacy domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat To overcome these challenges to restore the soul and secure the future of America requires so much more than words It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy unity Unity In another January on New Year s Day in Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation When he put pen to paper the President said and I quote If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it My whole soul is in it Today on this January day my whole soul is in this bringing America together uniting our people uniting our Nation And I ask every American to join me in this cause uniting to fight the foes we face anger resentment and hatred extremism lawlessness violence disease joblessness and hopelessness With unity we can do great things important things We can right wrongs We can put people to work in good jobs We can teach our children in safe schools We can overcome the deadly virus We can reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all We can deliver racial justice and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real But I also know they are not new Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism nativism fear demonization have long torn us apart The battle is perennial And victory is never assured Through the Civil War the Great Depression World War through struggle sacrifice and setbacks our better angels have always prevailed In each of these moments enough of us enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward And we can do that now History faith and reason show the way the way of unity We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors We can treat each other with dignity and respect We can join forces stop the shouting and lower the temperature For without unity there is no peace only bitterness and fury No progress only exhausting outrage No nation only a state of chaos This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge and unity is the path forward And we must meet this moment as the United States of America If we do that I guarantee you we will not fail We have never ever ever ever failed in America when we have acted together And so today at this time in this place let s start afresh all of us Let s begin to listen to one another hear one another see one another show respect to one another Politics doesn t have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path Every disagreement doesn t have to be a cause for total war And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured My fellow Americans we have to be different than this America has to be better than this And I believe America is so much better than this Just look around Here we stand in the shadow of the Capitol dome as was mentioned earlier completed amid the Civil War when the Union itself was literally hanging in the balance Yet we endured we prevailed Here we stand looking out on the great Mall where Dr King spoke of his dream Here we stand where years ago at another Inaugural thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote And today we mark the swearing in of the first woman in American history elected to national office Vice President Kamala Harris Don t tell me things can t change Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington Cemetery where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace And here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people to stop the work of our democracy to drive us from this sacred ground It did not happen It will never happen not today not tomorrow not ever not ever To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you ve placed in us To all those who did not support us let me say this Hear me out as we move forward Take a measure of me and my heart And if you still disagree so be it That s democracy That s America The right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our Republic is perhaps this Nation s greatest strength Yet hear me clearly Disagreement must not lead to disunion And I pledge this to you I will be a President for all Americans all Americans And I promise you I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did Many centuries ago Saint Augustine a saint of my church wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love defined by the common objects of their love What are the common objects we as Americans love That define us as Americans I think we know opportunity security liberty dignity respect honor and yes the truth Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson There is truth and there are lies lies told for power and for profit And each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens as Americans and especially as leaders leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our Nation to defend the truth and defeat the lies Look I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation I understand they worry about their jobs I understand like my dad they lay at bed at night staring at the ceiling wondering Can I keep my health care Can I pay my mortgage Thinking about their families about what comes next I promise you I get it But the answer is not to turn inward to retreat into competing factions distrusting those who don t look like you or worship the way you do or don t get their news from the same sources you do We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue rural versus urban conservative versus liberal We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts if we show a little tolerance and humility and if we re willing to stand in the other person s shoes as my mom would say just for a moment Stand in their shoes Because here is the thing about life There is no accounting for what fate will deal you Some days when you need a hand There are other days when we re called to lend a hand That s how it has to be That is what we do for one another And if we are this way our country will be stronger more prosperous more ready for the future And we can still disagree My fellow Americans in the work ahead of us we re going to need each other We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter We re entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one Nation One Nation And I promise you this As the Bible says Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning We will get through this together together Look folks all my colleagues that I served with in the House and the Senate up here We all understand the world is watching watching all of us today So here is my message to those beyond our borders America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again not to meet yesterday s challenges but today s and tomorrow s challenges And we ll lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace progress and security Look you all know we have been through so much in this Nation And in my first act as President I d like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic those fellow Americans moms dads husbands wives sons daughters friends neighbors and coworkers We will honor them by becoming the people and Nation we know we can and should be So I ask you let s say a silent prayer for those who have lost their lives for those they left behind and for our country At this point a moment of silence was observed Amen Folks this is a time of testing We face an attack on our democracy and on truth a raging virus growing inequity the sting of systemic racism a climate in crisis America s role in the world Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways But the fact is we face them all at once presenting this Nation with one of the gravest of responsibilities we ve had Now we re going to be tested Are we going to step up All of us It is time for boldness for there is so much to do And this is certain I promise you We will be judged you and I by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era Will we rise to the occasion is the question Will we master this rare and difficult hour Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children I believe we must I m sure you do as well I believe we will And when we do we will write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America the American story a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me It s called American Anthem and there s one verse that stands out at least for me and it goes like this The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this dayWhat shall be our legacy What will our children say Let me know in my heart when my days are throughAmerica America I gave my best to you Let s add let s us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great Nation If we do this then when our days are through our children and our children s children will say of us They gave their best They did their duty They healed a broken land My fellow Americans I close today where I began with a sacred oath Before God and all of you I give you my word I will always level with you I will defend the Constitution I will defend our democracy I will defend America And I will give all all of you keep everything you I do in your service thinking not of power but of possibilities not of personal interest but of the public good And together we shall write an American story of hope not fear of unity not division of light not darkness A story of decency and dignity love and healing greatness and goodness May this be the story that guides us the story that inspires us and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history we met the moment democracy and hope truth and justice did not die on our watch but thrived that America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world That is what we owe our forebearers one another and generations to follow So with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time sustained by faith driven by conviction and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts May God bless America and may God protect our troops Thank you America",2021,"democratic",2
"Donald J. Trump (1st Term)","Chief Justice Roberts President Carter President Clinton President Bush President Obama fellow Americans and people of the world Thank you We the citizens of America are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many many years to come We will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done Every years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition They have been magnificent Thank you Today s ceremony however has very special meaning Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people For too long a small group in our Nation s Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country Their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our Nation s Capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment It belongs to you It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America This is your day This is your celebration And this the United States of America is your country What truly matters is not which party controls our Government but whether our Government is controlled by the people January will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this Nation again The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer Everyone is listening to you now You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens Americans want great schools for their children safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public But for too many of our citizens a different reality exists Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential This American carnage stops right here and stops right now We are one Nation and their pain is our pain their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success We share one heart one home and one glorious destiny The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans For many decades we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military We ve defended other nations borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay We ve made other countries rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon One by one the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world But that is the past And now we are looking only to the future We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power From this day forward a new vision will govern our land From this day forward it s going to be only America first America first Every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down America will start winning again winning like never before We will bring back our jobs We will bring back our borders We will bring back our wealth And we will bring back our dreams We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful Nation We will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor We will follow two simple rules Buy American and hire American We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example we will shine for everyone to follow We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other When you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice The Bible tells us How good and pleasant it is when God s people live together in unity We must speak our minds openly debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity When America is united America is totally unstoppable There should be no fear We are protected and we will always be protected We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly we will be protected by God Finally we must think big and dream even bigger In America we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action constantly complaining but never doing anything about it The time for empty talk is over Now arrives the hour of action Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America We will not fail Our country will thrive and prosper again We stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the Earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies industries and technologies of tomorrow A new national pride will stir our souls lift our sights and heal our divisions It s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget that whether we are Black or Brown or White we all bleed the same red blood of patriots we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska they look up at the same night sky they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator So to all Americans in every city near and far small and large from mountain to mountain from ocean to ocean hear these words You will never be ignored again Your voice your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way Together we will make America strong again We will make America wealthy again We will make America proud again We will make America safe again And yes together we will make America great again Thank you God bless you and God bless America Thank you God bless America",2017,"republican",3
"Barack Obama","Thank you Thank you so much Vice President Biden Mr Chief Justice Members of the United States Congress distinguished guests and fellow citizens Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution We affirm the promise of our democracy We recall that what binds this Nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names What makes us exceptional what makes us American is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Today we continue a never ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time For history tells us that while these truths may be self evident they ve never been self executing that while freedom is a gift from God it must be secured by His people here on Earth The patriots of did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob They gave to us a republic a government of and by and for the people entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed And for more than years we have Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half slave and half free We made ourselves anew and vowed to move forward together Together we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce schools and colleges to train our workers Together we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play Together we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people from life s worst hazards and misfortune Through it all we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society s ills can be cured through government alone Our celebration of initiative and enterprise our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility these are constants in our character But we have always understood that when times change so must we that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action For the American people can no more meet the demands of today s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias No single person can train all the math and science teachers we ll need to equip our children for the future or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores Now more than ever we must do these things together as one nation and one people This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience A decade of war is now ending An economic recovery has begun America s possibilities are limitless for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands youth and drive diversity and openness an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention My fellow Americans we are made for this moment and we will seize it so long as we seize it together For we the people understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it We believe that America s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else because she is an American she is free and she is equal not just in the eyes of God but also in our own We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government revamp our Tax Code reform our schools and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder learn more reach higher But while the means will change our purpose endures a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American That is what this moment requires That is what will give real meaning to our creed We the people still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future For we remember the lessons of our past when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky or happiness for the few We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives any one of us at any time may face a job loss or a sudden illness or a home swept away in a terrible storm The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security these things do not sap our initiative they strengthen us They do not make us a nation of takers they free us to take the risks that make this country great We the people still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves but to all posterity We will respond to the threat of climate change knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult But America cannot resist this transition we must lead it We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries we must claim its promise That s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure our forests and waterways our crop lands and snow capped peaks That is how we will preserve our planet commanded to our care by God That s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared We the people still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war Our brave men and women in uniform tempered by the flames of battle are unmatched in skill and courage Our citizens seared by the memory of those we have lost know too well the price that is paid for liberty The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends and we must carry those lessons into this time as well We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully not because we are naive about the dangers we face but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation We will support democracy from Asia to Africa from the Americas to the Middle East because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom And we must be a source of hope to the poor the sick the marginalized the victims of prejudice not out of mere charity but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes tolerance and opportunity human dignity and justice We the people declare today that the most evident of truths that all of us are created equal is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall just as it guided all those men and women sung and unsung who left footprints along this great Mall to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth It is now our generation s task to carry on what those pioneers began For our journey is not complete until our wives our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created equal then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country Our journey is not complete until all our children from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm That is our generation s task to make these words these rights these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness Progress does not compel us to settle centuries long debates about the role of government for all time but it does require us to act in our time For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name calling as reasoned debate We must act knowing that our work will be imperfect We must act we must act knowing that today s victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in years and years and years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall My fellow Americans the oath I have sworn before you today like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol was an oath to God and country not party or faction And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope You and I as citizens have the power to set this country s course You and I as citizens have the obligation to shape the debates of our time not only with the votes we cast but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals Let us each of us now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright With common effort and common purpose with passion and dedication let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom Thank you God bless you and may He forever bless these United States of America",2013,"democratic",4
"Barack Obama","My fellow citizens I stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors I thank President Bush for his service to our Nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition Forty four Americans have now taken the Presidential oath The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace Yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms At these moments America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents So it has been so it must be with this generation of Americans That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood Our Nation is at war against a far reaching network of violence and hatred Our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the Nation for a new age Homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered Our health care is too costly Our schools fail too many And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet These are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land a nagging fear that America s decline is inevitable that the next generation must lower its sights Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real They are serious and they are many They will not be met easily or in a short span of time But know this America They will be met On this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord On this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics We remain a young nation but in the words of Scripture the time has come to set aside childish things The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the God given promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness In reaffirming the greatness of our Nation we understand that greatness is never a given It must be earned Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less It has not been the path for the fainthearted for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame Rather it has been the risk takers the doers the makers of things some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path toward prosperity and freedom For us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life For us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard Earth For us they fought and died in places like Concord and Gettysburg Normandy and Khe Sanh Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked til their hands were raw so that we might live a better life They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction This is the journey we continue today We remain the most prosperous powerful nation on Earth Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began Our minds are no less inventive Our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year Our capacity remains undiminished But our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions that time has surely passed Starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America For everywhere we look there is work to be done The state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth We will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology s wonders to raise health care s quality and lower its cost We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age All this we can do All this we will do Now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans Their memories are short for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply The question we ask today is not whether our Government is too big or too small but whether it works whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified Where the answer is yes we intend to move forward Where the answer is no programs will end And those of us who manage the public s dollars will be held to account to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched But this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control The Nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good As for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals Our Founding Fathers faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations Those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expedience s sake And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that America is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and we are ready to lead once more Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions They understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please Instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use Our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint We are the keepers of this legacy Guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort even greater cooperation and understanding between nations We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard earned peace in Afghanistan With old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet We will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken You cannot outlast us and we will defeat you For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness We are a nation of Christians and Muslims Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers We are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this Earth And because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace To the Muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society s ills on the West know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist To the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the world s resources without regard to effect for the world has changed and we must change with it As we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who at this very hour patrol far off deserts and distant mountains They have something to tell us today just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves And yet at this moment a moment that will define a generation it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all For as much as Government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this Nation relies It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours It is the firefighter s courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parent s willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate Our challenges may be new The instruments with which we meet them may be new But those values upon which our success depends honesty and hard work courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism these things are old These things are true They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history What is demanded then is a return to these truths What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves our Nation and the world Duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task This is the price and the promise of citizenship This is the source of our confidence the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent Mall and why a man whose father less than years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath So let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled In the year of America s birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river The Capital was abandoned The enemy was advancing The snow was stained with blood At a moment when the outcome of our Revolution was most in doubt the Father of our Nation ordered these words be read to the people Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survive that the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet it America in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words With hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come Let it be said by our children s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter And with eyes fixed on the horizon and God s grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations Thank you God bless you and God bless the United States of America",2009,"democratic",5
"George W. Bush","Vice President Cheney Mr Chief Justice President Carter President Bush President Clinton Members of the United States Congress reverend clergy distinguished guests fellow citizens On this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country I am grateful for the honor of this hour mindful of the consequential times in which we live and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed At this second gathering our duties are defined not by the words I use but by the history we have seen together For a half a century America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet years of repose years of sabbatical and then there came a day of fire We have seen our vulnerability and we have seen its deepest source For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant and that is the force of human freedom We are led by events and common sense to one conclusion The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world America s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one From the day of our founding we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this Earth has rights and dignity and matchless value because they bear the image of the Maker of heaven and Earth Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation It is the honorable achievement of our fathers Now it is the urgent requirement of our Nation s security and the calling of our time So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world This is not primarily the task of arms though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary Freedom by its nature must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities And when the soul of a nation finally speaks the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice attain their own freedom and make their own way The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it America s influence is not unlimited but fortunately for the oppressed America s influence is considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom s cause My most solemn duty is to protect this Nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats Some have unwisely chosen to test America s resolve and have found it firm We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation the moral choice between oppression which is always wrong and freedom which is eternally right America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people America s belief in human dignity will guide our policies Yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators They are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed In the long run there is no justice without freedom and there can be no human rights without human liberty Some I know have questioned the global appeal of liberty though this time in history four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen is an odd time for doubt Americans of all people should never be surprised by the power of our ideals Eventually the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery Liberty will come to those who love it Today America speaks anew to the peoples of the world All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know The United States will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors When you stand for your liberty we will stand with you Democratic reformers facing repression prison or exile can know America sees you for who you are the future leaders of your free country The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just God cannot long retain it The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know To serve your people you must learn to trust them Start on this journey of progress and justice and America will walk at your side And all the allies of the United States can know We honor your friendship we rely on your counsel and we depend on your help Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom s enemies The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies defeat Today I also speak anew to my fellow citizens From all of you I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America which you have granted in good measure Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this Nation tens of millions have achieved their freedom And as hope kindles hope millions more will find it By our efforts we have lit a fire as well a fire in the minds of men It warms those who feel its power It burns those who fight its progress And one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice All Americans have witnessed this idealism and some for the first time I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers You have seen that life is fragile and evil is real and courage triumphs Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants larger than yourself and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character America has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home the unfinished work of American freedom In a world moving toward liberty we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty In America s ideal of freedom citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act the Social Security Act and the GI bill of rights And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country we will bring the highest standards to our schools and build an ownership society We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses retirement savings and health insurance preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal In America s ideal of freedom the public interest depends on private character on integrity and tolerance toward others and the rule of conscience in our own lives Self government relies in the end on the governing of the self That edifice of character is built in families supported by communities with standards and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai the Sermon on the Mount the words of the Koran and the varied faiths of our people Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday today and forever In America s ideal of freedom the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another Our Nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love Americans at our best value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth And our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time From the perspective of a single day including this day of dedication the issues and questions before our country are many From the viewpoint of centuries the questions that come to us are narrowed and few Did our generation advance the cause of freedom And did our character bring credit to that cause These questions that judge us also unite us because Americans of every party and background Americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom We have known divisions which must be healed to move forward in great purposes and I will strive in good faith to heal them Yet those divisions do not define America We felt the unity and fellowship of our Nation when freedom came under attack and our response came like a single hand over a single heart And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability it is human choices that move events not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation God moves and chooses as He wills We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind the hunger in dark places the longing of the soul When our Founders declared a new order of the ages when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner Freedom Now they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled History has an ebb and flow of justice but history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the Author of Liberty When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration a witness said It rang as if it meant something In our time it means something still America in this young century proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof Renewed in our strength tested but not weary we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom May God bless you and may He watch over the United States of America",2005,"republican",6
"George W. Bush","Thank you all Chief Justice Rehnquist President Carter President Bush President Clinton distinguished guests and my fellow citizens The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history yet common in our country With a simple oath we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings As I begin I thank President Clinton for his service to our Nation and I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace I am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of America s leaders have come before me and so many will follow We have a place all of us in a long story a story we continue but whose end we will not see It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old the story of a slaveholding society that became a servant of freedom the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess to defend but not to conquer It is the American story a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs that everyone deserves a chance that no insignificant person was ever born Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws And though our Nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed we must follow no other course Through much of the last century America s faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea Now it is a seed upon the wind taking root in many nations Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country It is the inborn hope of our humanity an ideal we carry but do not own a trust we bear and pass along Even after nearly years we have a long way yet to travel While many of our citizens prosper others doubt the promise even the justice of our own country The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth And sometimes our differences run so deep it seems we share a continent but not a country We do not accept this and we will not allow it Our unity our Union is a serious work of leaders and citizens and every generation And this is my solemn pledge I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward America has never been united by blood or birth or soil We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens Every child must be taught these principles Every citizen must uphold them And every immigrant by embracing these ideals makes our country more not less American Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our Nation s promise through civility courage compassion and character America at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect fair dealing and forgiveness Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small But the stakes for America are never small If our country does not lead the cause of freedom it will not be led If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism If we permit our economy to drift and decline the vulnerable will suffer most We must live up to the calling we share Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism of community over chaos And this commitment if we keep it is a way to shared accomplishment America at its best is also courageous Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war when defeating common dangers defined our common good Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations Together we will reclaim America s schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives We will reform Social Security and Medicare sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent And we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans We will build our defenses beyond challenge lest weakness invite challenge We will confront weapons of mass destruction so that a new century is spared new horrors The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice shaping a balance of power that favors freedom We will defend our allies and our interests We will show purpose without arrogance We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength And to all nations we will speak for the values that gave our Nation birth America at its best is compassionate In the quiet of American conscience we know that deep persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation s promise And whatever our views of its cause we can agree that children at risk are not at fault Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God they are failures of love And the proliferation of prisons however necessary is no substitute for hope and order in our souls Where there is suffering there is duty Americans in need are not strangers they are citizens not problems but priorities And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health for civil rights and common schools Yet compassion is the work of a nation not just a government And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor s touch or a pastor s prayer Church and charity synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty But we can listen to those who do And I can pledge our Nation to a goal When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho we will not pass to the other side America at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats it is a call to conscience And though it requires sacrifice it brings a deeper fulfillment We find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free Our public interest depends on private character on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness on uncounted unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom Sometimes in life we re called to do great things But as a saint of our times has said Every day we are called to do small things with great love The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone I will live and lead by these principles to advance my convictions with civility to serve the public interest with courage to speak for greater justice and compassion to call for responsibility and try to live it as well In all these ways I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times What you do is as important as anything Government does I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort to defend needed reforms against easy attacks to serve your Nation beginning with your neighbor I ask you to be citizens Citizens not spectators citizens not subjects responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character Americans are generous and strong and decent not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves When this spirit of citizenship is missing no Government program can replace it When this spirit is present no wrong can stand against it After the Declaration of Independence was signed Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration The years and changes accumulate but the themes of this day he would know our Nation s grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity We are not this story s author who fills time and eternity with his purpose Yet his purpose is achieved in our duty And our duty is fulfilled in service to one another Never tiring never yielding never finishing we renew that purpose today to make our country more just and generous to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life This work continues the story goes on and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm God bless you all and God bless America",2001,"republican",7
"William J. Clinton","My fellow citizens at this last Presidential Inauguration of the th century let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century in a new millennium but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs a moment that will define our course and our character for decades to comes See APP Note We must keep our old democracy forever young Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land let us set our sights upon a land of new promise The promise of America was born in the th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal It was extended and preserved in the th century when our Nation spread across the continent saved the Union and abolished the awful scourge of slavery Then in turmoil and triumph that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American Century And what a century it has been America became the world s mightiest industrial power saved the world from tyranny in two World Wars and a long cold war and time and again reached out across the globe to millions who like us longed for the blessings of liberty Along the way Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all split the atom and explored the heavens invented the computer and the microchip and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities and extending the circle of citizenship opportunity and dignity to women Now for the third time a new century is upon us and another time to choose We began the th century with a choice to spread our Nation from coast to coast We began the th century with a choice to harness the industrial revolution to our values of free enterprise conservation and human decency Those choices made all the difference At the dawn of the st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the information age and the global society to unleash the limitless potential of all our people and yes to form a more perfect Union When last we gathered our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our Nation In these years we have been touched by tragedy exhilarated by challenge strengthened by achievement America stands alone as the world s indispensable nation Once again our economy is the strongest on Earth Once again we are building stronger families thriving communities better educational opportunities a cleaner environment Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts Our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work And once again we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of Government Today we can declare Government is not the problem and Government is not the solution We the American people we are the solution Our Founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day As times change so Government must change We need a new Government for a new century humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves a Government that is smaller lives within its means and does more with less Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests around the world and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives Government should do more not less The preeminent mission of our new Government is to give all Americans an opportunity not a guarantee but a real opportunity to build better lives Beyond that my fellow citizens the future is up to us Our Founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our Union depends upon responsible citizenship And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century There is work to do work that Government alone cannot do teaching children to read hiring people off welfare rolls coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime taking time out of our own lives to serve others Each and every one of us in our own way must assume personal responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our neighbors and our Nation Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century For any one of us to succeed we must succeed as one America The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future Will we be one Nation one people with one common destiny or not Will we all come together or come apart The divide of race has been America s constant curse And each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices Prejudice and contempt cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different These forces have nearly destroyed our Nation in the past They plague us still They fuel the fanaticism of terror And they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world These obsessions cripple both those who hate and of course those who are hated robbing both of what they might become We cannot we will not succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere We shall overcome them And we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another Our rich texture of racial religious and political diversity will be a godsend in the st century Great rewards will come to those who can live together learn together work together forge new ties that bind together As this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines Ten years ago the Internet was the mystical province of physicists today it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren Scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life Cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand The world is no longer divided into two hostile camps Instead now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries Growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over And for the very first time in all of history more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship My fellow Americans as we look back at this remarkable century we may ask can we hope not just to follow but even to surpass the achievements of the th century in America and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy To that question every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding Yes This is the heart of our task With a new vision of Government a new sense of responsibility a new spirit of community we will sustain America s journey The promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise In this new land education will be every citizen s most prized possession Our schools will have the highest standards in the world igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy And the doors of higher education will be open to all The knowledge and power of the information age will be within reach not just of the few but of every classroom every library every child Parents and children will have time not only to work but to read and play together And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home a better job the certain chance to go to college Our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore Everyone who can work will work with today s permanent under class part of tomorrow s growing middle class New miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now but the children and hard working families too long denied We will stand mighty for peace and freedom and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear chemical or biological weapons Ports and airports farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas And the world s greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations a nation that balances its budget but never loses the balance of its values a nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time a nation that fortifies the world s most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water air and majestic land And in this land of new promise we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all Americans Fellow citizens let us build that America a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens Prosperity and power yes they are important and we must maintain them But let us never forget the greatest progress we have made and the greatest progress we have yet to make is in the human heart In the end all the world s wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit Thirty four years ago the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there at the other end of this Mall in words that moved the conscience of a nation Like a prophet of old he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart Martin Luther King s dream was the American dream His quest is our quest the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed Our history has been built on such dreams and labors And by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of America in the st century To that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office I ask the Members of Congress here to join in that pledge The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore No they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach and to move on with America s mission America demands and deserves big things from us and nothing big ever came from being small Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal Bernardin when facing the end of his own life He said It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time on acrimony and division Fellow citizens we must not waste the precious gift of this time For all of us are on that same journey of our lives and our journey too will come to an end But the journey of our America must go on And so my fellow Americans we must be strong for there is much to dare The demands of our time are great and they are different Let us meet them with faith and courage with patience and a grateful happy heart Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history Yes let us build our bridge a bridge wide enough and strong enough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new promise May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see whose names we may never know say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American dream alive for all her children with the American promise of a more perfect Union a reality for all her people with America s bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world From the height of this place and the summit of this century let us go forth May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead and always always bless our America",1997,"democratic",8
"William J. Clinton","My fellow citizens today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal This ceremony is held in the depth of winter but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world we force the spring a spring reborn in the world s oldest democracy that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America When our Founders boldly declared America s independence to the world and our purposes to the Almighty they knew that America to endure would have to change not change for change s sake but change to preserve America s ideals life liberty the pursuit of happiness Though we marched to the music of our time our mission is timeless Each generation of Americans must define what it means to be an American On behalf of our Nation I salute my predecessor President Bush for his half century of service to America And I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression fascism and communism Today a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues Raised in unrivaled prosperity we inherit an economy that is still the world s strongest but is weakened by business failures stagnant wages increasing inequality and deep divisions among our own people When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat Now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the world Communications and commerce are global Investment is mobile Technology is almost magical And ambition for a better life is now universal We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world And the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it But when most people are working harder for less when others cannot work at all when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises great and small when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their freedom and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead we have not made change our friend We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps but we have not done so instead we have drifted And that drifting has eroded our resources fractured our economy and shaken our confidence Though our challenges are fearsome so are our strengths Americans have ever been a restless questing hopeful people And we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us From our Revolution to the Civil War to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our Nation we would need dramatic change from time to time Well my fellow Americans this is our time Let us embrace it Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift and a new season of American renewal has begun To renew America we must be bold We must do what no generation has had to do before We must invest more in our own people in their jobs and in their future and at the same time cut our massive debt And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity It will not be easy It will require sacrifice but it can be done and done fairly not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake We must provide for our Nation the way a family provides for its children Our Founders saw themselves in the light of posterity We can do no less Anyone who has ever watched a child s eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is Posterity is the world to come the world for whom we hold our ideals from whom we have borrowed our planet and to whom we bear sacred responsibility We must do what America does best offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our Government or from each other Let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country To renew America we must revitalize our democracy This beautiful Capital like every capital since the dawn of civilization is often a place of intrigue and calculation Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out who is up and who is down forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way Americans deserve better And in this city today there are people who want to do better And so I say to all of you here Let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people Let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America Let us resolve to make our Government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called bold persistent experimentation a Government for our tomorrows not our yesterdays Let us give this Capital back to the people to whom it belongs To renew America we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic The world economy the world environment the world AIDS crisis the world arms race they affect us all Today as an older order passes the new world is more free but less stable Communism s collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers Clearly America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make While America rebuilds at home we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world Together with our friends and allies we will work to shape change lest it engulf us When our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied we will act with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible with force when necessary The brave Americans serving our Nation today in the Persian Gulf in Somalia and wherever else they stand are testament to our resolve But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas which are still new in many lands Across the world we see them embraced and we rejoice Our hopes our hearts our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom Their cause is America s cause The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus You have cast your votes in historic numbers And you have changed the face of Congress the Presidency and the political process itself Yes you my fellow Americans have forced the spring Now we must do the work the season demands To that work I now turn with all the authority of my office I ask the Congress to join with me But no President no Congress no Government can undertake this mission alone My fellow Americans you too must play your part in our renewal I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service to act on your idealism by helping troubled children keeping company with those in need reconnecting our torn communities There is so much to be done enough indeed for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service too In serving we recognize a simple but powerful truth We need each other and we must care for one another Today we do more than celebrate America We rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America an idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge an idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate we the fortunate and the unfortunate might have been each other an idea ennobled by the faith that our Nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity an idea infused with the conviction that America s long heroic journey must go forever upward And so my fellow Americans as we stand at the edge of the st century let us begin anew with energy and hope with faith and discipline And let us work until our work is done The Scripture says And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley We have heard the trumpets We have changed the guard And now each in our own way and with God s help we must answer the call Thank you and God bless you all",1993,"democratic",9
"Ronald Reagan","Senator Mathias Chief Justice Burger Vice President Bush Speaker O Neill Senator Dole reverend clergy and members of my family and friends and my fellow citizens This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who for a time has been absent Senator John Stennis God bless you and welcome back There is however one who is not with us today Representative Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night And I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer The President resumed speaking after a moment of silence Amen There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you ve bestowed on me I ll do my utmost to be deserving of your trust This is as Senator Mathias told us the th time that we the people have celebrated this historic occasion When the first President George Washington placed his hand upon the Bible he stood less than a single day s journey by horseback from raw untamed wilderness There were million Americans in a union of States Today we are times as many in a union of States We ve lighted the world with our inventions gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help journeyed to the Moon and safely returned So much has changed and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago When I took this oath years ago I did so in a time of economic stress Voices were raised saying that we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory But we the present day Americans are not given to looking backward In this blessed land there is always a better tomorrow Four years ago I spoke to you of a New Beginning and we have accomplished that But in another sense our New Beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when for the first time in history government the people said was not our master it is our servant its only power that which we the people allow it to have That system has never failed us but for a time we failed the system We asked things of government that government was not equipped to give We yielded authority to the National Government that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to the people themselves We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase By we knew it was time to renew our faith to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society We believed then and now There are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams And we were right to believe that Tax rates have been reduced inflation cut dramatically and more people are employed than ever before in our history We are creating a nation once again vibrant robust and alive But there are many mountains yet to climb We will not rest until every American enjoys the fullness of freedom dignity and opportunity as our birthright It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic And if we meet this challenge these will be years when Americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress when our values of faith family work and neighborhood were restated for a modern age when our economy was finally freed from government s grip when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reductions and by rebuilding our defenses our economy and developing new technologies helped preserve peace in a troubled world when America courageously supported the struggle for individual liberty self government and free enterprise throughout the world and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom My fellow citizens our nation is poised for greatness We must do what we know is right and do it with all our might Let history say of us These were golden years when the American Revolution was reborn when freedom gained new life and America reached for her best Our two party system has solved us served us I should say well over the years but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans united in a common cause Two of our Founding Fathers a Boston lawyer named Adams and a Virginia planter named Jefferson members of that remarkable group who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start the world over again left us an important lesson They had become in the years then in government bitter political rivals in the Presidential election of Then years later when both were retired and age had softened their anger they began to speak to each other again through letters A bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours In the th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence they both died They died on the same day within a few hours of each other and that day was the Fourth of July In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives Jefferson wrote It carries me back to the times when beset with difficulties and dangers we were fellow laborers in the same cause struggling for what is most valuable to man his right of self government Laboring always at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us and yet passing harmless we rode through the storm with heart and hand Well with heart and hand let us stand as one today one people under God determined that our future shall be worthy of our past As we do we must not repeat the well intentioned errors of our past We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated Federal Establishment You elected us in to end this prescription for disaster and I don t believe you reelected us in to reverse course At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by straight months of economic growth Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress We have begun to increase the rewards for work savings and investment reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people s lives We must simplify our tax system make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn We must think anew and move with a new boldness so every American who seeks work can find work so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things to be heroes who heal our sick feed the hungry protect peace among nations and leave this world a better place The time has come for a new American emancipation a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country My friends together we can do this and do it we must so help me God From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth a more productive fulfilled and united people and a stronger America an America that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature music and poetry and the values of faith courage and love A dynamic economy with more citizens working and paying taxes will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits But an almost unbroken years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning We ve come to a turning point a moment for hard decisions I have asked the Cabinet and my staff a question and now I put the same question to all of you If not us who And if not now when It must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget We can then begin reducing the national debt I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year Beyond this we must take further steps to permanently control government s power to tax and spend We must act now to protect future generations from government s desire to spend its citizens money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government takes in We have already started returning to the people and to State and local governments responsibilities better handled by them Now there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social compassion But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged And here a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life where the old and infirm are cared for the young and yes the unborn protected and the unfortunate looked after and made self sufficient Now there is another area where the Federal Government can play a part As an older American I remember a time when people of different race creed or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and yes in law There s no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we ve made toward the brotherhood of man that God intended for us Let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens Let us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity society in which all of us white and black rich and poor young and old will go forward together arm in arm Again let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the Earth we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last best hope of man on Earth I ve spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our National Government Now let me turn to a task that is the primary responsibility of National Government the safety and security of our people Today we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on Earth Yet history has shown that peace does not come nor will our freedom be preserved by good will alone There are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom One nation the Soviet Union has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons We ve made progress in restoring our defense capability But much remains to be done There must be no wavering by us nor any doubts by others that America will meet her responsibilities to remain free secure and at peace There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security and that is to reduce the need for it And this we re trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union We re not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons we seek instead to reduce their number We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth Now for decades we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it Is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs I have approved a research program to find if we can a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target It wouldn t kill people it would destroy weapons It wouldn t militarize space it would help demilitarize the arsenals of Earth It would render nuclear weapons obsolete We will meet with the Soviets hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction We strive for peace and security heartened by the changes all around us Since the turn of the century the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold Human freedom is on the march and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit People worldwide hunger for the right of self determination for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress America must remain freedom s staunchest friend for freedom is our best ally and it is the world s only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war Every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace So we go forward today a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose With our alliances strengthened with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion we look to a future rich in possibilities And all of this is because we worked and acted together not as members of political parties but as Americans My friends we live in a world that s lit by lightning So much is changing and will change but so much endures and transcends time History is a ribbon always unfurling History is a journey And as we continue our journey we think of those who traveled before us We stand again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy well we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn t gotten so cold Laughter Now we re standing inside this symbol of our democracy and we see and hear again the echoes of our past a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge a lonely President paces the darkened halls and ponders his struggle to preserve the Union the men of the Alamo call out encouragement to each other a settler pushes west and sings a song and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air It is the American sound It is hopeful big hearted idealistic daring decent and fair That s our heritage that s our song We sing it still For all our problems our differences we are together as of old We raise our voices to the God who is the Author of this most tender music And may He continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound in unity affection and love one people under God dedicated to the dream of freedom that He has placed in the human heart called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world God bless you and God bless America",1985,"republican",10
"Ronald Reagan","Senator Hatfield Mr Chief Justice Mr President Vice President Bush Vice President Mondale Senator Baker Speaker O Neill Reverend Moomaw and my fellow citizens To a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really are In the eyes of many in the world this every year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle Mr President I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition By your gracious cooperation in the transition process you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic The business of our nation goes forward These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history It distorts our economic decisions penalizes thrift and crushes the struggling young and the fixed income elderly alike It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment human misery and personal indignity Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity But great as our tax burden is it has not kept pace with public spending For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit mortgaging our future and our children s future for the temporary convenience of the present To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social cultural political and economic upheavals You and I as individuals can by borrowing live beyond our means but for only a limited period of time Why then should we think that collectively as a nation we re not bound by that same limitation We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow And let there be no misunderstanding We are going to begin to act beginning today The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades They will not go away in days weeks or months but they will go away They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now as we ve had in the past to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom In this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem From time to time we ve been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self rule that government by an elite group is superior to government for by and of the people Well if no one among us is capable of governing himself then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else All of us together in and out of government must bear the burden The solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price We hear much of special interest groups Well our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions and it crosses political party lines It is made up of men and women who raise our food patrol our streets man our mines and factories teach our children keep our homes and heal us when we re sick professionals industrialists shopkeepers clerks cabbies and truck drivers They are in short We the people this breed called Americans Well this administration s objective will be a healthy vigorous growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs All must share in the productive work of this new beginning and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength we can have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world So as we begin let us take inventory We are a nation that has a government not the other way around And this makes us special among the nations of the Earth Our government has no power except that granted it by the people It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States the States created the Federal Government Now so there will be no misunderstanding it s not my intention to do away with government It is rather to make it work work with us not over us to stand by our side not ride on our back Government can and must provide opportunity not smother it foster productivity not stifle it If we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much prospered as no other people on Earth it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth The price for this freedom at times has been high but we have never been unwilling to pay that price It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government It is time for us to realize that we re too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams We re not as some would have us believe doomed to an inevitable decline I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing So with all the creative energy at our command let us begin an era of national renewal Let us renew our determination our courage and our strength And let us renew our faith and our hope We have every right to dream heroic dreams Those who say that we re in a time when there are not heroes they just don t know where to look You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates Others a handful in number produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond You meet heroes across a counter and they re on both sides of that counter There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs new wealth and opportunity They re individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church charity culture art and education Their patriotism is quiet but deep Their values sustain our national life Now I have used the words they and their in speaking of these heroes I could say you and your because I m addressing the heroes of whom I speak you the citizens of this blessed land Your dreams your hopes your goals are going to be the dreams the hopes and the goals of this administration so help me God We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup How can we love our country and not love our countrymen and loving them reach out a hand when they fall heal them when they re sick and provide opportunity to make them self sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory Can we solve the problems confronting us Well the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic yes To paraphrase Winston Churchill I did not take the oath I ve just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world s strongest economy In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government Progress may be slow measured in inches and feet not miles but we will progress It is time to reawaken this industrial giant to get government back within its means and to lighten our punitive tax burden And these will be our first priorities and on these principles there will be no compromise On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers Dr Joseph Warren president of the Massachusetts Congress said to his fellow Americans Our country is in danger but not to be despaired of On you depend the fortunes of America You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn Act worthy of yourselves Well I believe we the Americans of today are ready to act worthy of ourselves ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves our children and our children s children And as we renew ourselves here in our own land we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment We will match loyalty with loyalty We will strive for mutually beneficial relations We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty for our own sovereignty is not for sale As for the enemies of freedom those who are potential adversaries they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people We will negotiate for it sacrifice for it we will not surrender for it now or ever Our forbearance should never be misunderstood Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will When action is required to preserve our national security we will act We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength Above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women It is a weapon our adversaries in today s world do not have It is a weapon that we as Americans do have Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors I m told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day and for that I m deeply grateful We are a nation under God and I believe God intended for us to be free It would be fitting and good I think if on each Inaugural Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held as you ve been told on this West Front of the Capitol Standing here one faces a magnificent vista opening up on this city s special beauty and history At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand Directly in front of me the monument to a monumental man George Washington father of our country A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood Off to one side the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River and on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery with its row upon row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood The Argonne Omaha Beach Salerno and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal Tarawa Pork Chop Hill the Chosin Reservoir and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam Under one such marker lies a young man Martin Treptow who left his job in a small town barbershop in to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division There on the western front he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire We re told that on his body was found a diary On the flyleaf under the heading My Pledge he had written these words America must win this war Therefore I will work I will save I will sacrifice I will endure I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make It does require however our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds to believe that together with God s help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us And after all why shouldn t we believe that We are Americans God bless you and thank you",1981,"republican",11
"Richard Nixon","I RICHARD NIXON do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States so help me God Mr Vice President Mr Speaker Mr Chief Justice Senator Cook Mrs Eisenhower and my fellow citizens of this great and good country we share together When we met here years ago America was bleak in spirit depressed by the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home As we meet here today we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace in the world The central question before us is How shall we use that peace Let us resolve that this era we are about to enter will not be what other postwar periods have so often been a time of retreat and isolation that leads to stagnation at home and invites new danger abroad Let us resolve that this will be what it can become a time of great responsibilities greatly borne in which we renew the spirit and the promise of America as we enter our third century as a nation This past year saw far reaching results from our new policies for peace By continuing to revitalize our traditional friendships and by our missions to Peking and to Moscow we were able to establish the base for a new and more durable pattern of relationships among the nations of the world Because of America s bold initiatives will be long remembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of World War II toward a lasting peace in the world The peace we seek in the world is not the flimsy peace which is merely an interlude between wars but a peace which can endure for generations to come It is important that we understand both the necessity and the limitations of America s role in maintaining that peace Unless we in America work to preserve the peace there will be no peace Unless we in America work to preserve freedom there will be no freedom But let us clearly understand the new nature of America s role as a result of the new policies we have adopted over these past years We shall respect our treaty commitments We shall support vigorously the principle that no country has the right to impose its will or rule on another by force We shall continue in this era of negotiation to work for the limitation of nuclear arms and to reduce the danger of confrontation between the great powers We shall do our share in defending peace and freedom in the world But we shall expect others to do their share The time has passed when America will make every other nation s conflict our own or make every other nation s future our responsibility or presume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own affairs Just as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future we also recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own future Just as America s role is indispensable in preserving the world s peace so is each nation s role indispensable in preserving its own peace Together with the rest of the world let us resolve to move forward from the beginnings we have made Let us continue to bring down the walls of hostility which have divided the world for too long and to build in their place bridges of understanding so that despite profound differences between systems of government the people of the world can be friends Let us build a structure of peace in the world in which the weak are as safe as the strong in which each respects the right of the other to live by a different system in which those who would influence others will do so by the strength of their ideas and not by the force of their arms Let us accept that high responsibility not as a burden but gladly gladly because the chance to build such a peace is the noblest endeavor in which a nation can engage gladly also because only if we act greatly in meeting our responsibilities abroad will we remain a great nation and only if we remain a great nation will we act greatly in meeting our challenges at home We have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to make life better in America to ensure better education better health better housing better transportation a cleaner environment to restore respect for law to make our communities more livable and to ensure the God given right of every American to full and equal opportunity Because the range of our needs is so great because the reach of our opportunities is so great let us be bold in our determination to meet those needs in new ways Just as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away from old policies that have failed so building a new era of progress at home requires turning away from old policies that have failed Abroad the shift from old policies to new has not been a retreat from our responsibilities but a better way to peace And at home the shift from old policies to new will not be a retreat from our responsibilities but a better way to progress Abroad and at home the key to those new responsibilities lies in the placing and the division of responsibility We have lived too long with the consequences of attempting to gather all power and responsibility in Washington Abroad and at home the time has come to turn away from the condescending policies of paternalism of Washington knows best A person can be expected to act responsibly only if he has responsibility This is human nature So let us encourage individuals at home and nations abroad to do more for themselves to decide more for themselves Let us locate responsibility in more places And let us measure what we will do for others by what they will do for themselves That is why today I offer no promise of a purely governmental solution for every problem We have lived too long with that false promise In trusting too much in government we have asked of it more than it can deliver This leads only to inflated expectations to reduced individual effort and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence both in what government can do and in what people can do Government must learn to take less from people so that people can do more for themselves Let us remember that America was built not by government but by people not by welfare but by work not by shirking responsibility but by seeking responsibility In our own lives let each of us ask not just what will government do for me but what can I do for myself In the challenges we face together let each of us ask not just how can government help but how can I help Your National Government has a great and vital role to play And I pledge to you that where this Government should act we will act boldly and we will lead boldly But just as important is the role that each and every one of us must play as an individual and as a member of his own community From this day forward let each of us make a solemn commitment in his own heart to bear his responsibility to do his part to live his ideals so that together we can see the dawn of a new age of progress for America and together as we celebrate our th anniversary as a nation we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to ourselves and to the world As America s longest and most difficult war comes to an end let us again learn to debate our differences with civility and decency And let each of us reach out for that one precious quality government cannot provide a new level of respect for the rights and feelings of one another a new level of respect for the individual human dignity which is the cherished birthright of every American Above all else the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves and in America In recent years that faith has been challenged Our children have been taught to be ashamed of their country ashamed of their parents ashamed of America s record at home and its role in the world At every turn we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with America and little that is right But I am confident that this will not be the judgment of history on these remarkable times in which we are privileged to live America s record in this century has been unparalleled in the world s h story for its responsibility for its generosity for its creativity and for its progress Let us be proud that our system has produced and provided more freedom and more abundance more widely shared than any system in the history of the world Let us be proud that in each of the four wars in which we have been engaged in this century including the one we are now bringing to an end we have fought not for our selfish advantage but to help others resist aggression And let us be proud that by our bold new initiatives by our steadfastness for peace with honor we have made a breakthrough toward creating in the world what the world has not known before a structure of peace that can last not merely for our time but for generations to come We are embarking here today on an era that presents challenges as great as those any nation or any generation has ever faced We shall answer to God to history and to our conscience for the way in which we use these years As I stand in this place so hallowed by history I think of others who have stood here before me I think of the dreams they had for America and I think of how each recognized that he needed help far beyond himself in order to make those dreams come true Today I ask your prayers that in the years ahead I may have God s help in making decisions that are right for America and I pray for your help so that together we may be worthy of our challenge Let us pledge together to make these next years the best years in America s history so that on its th birthday America will be as young and as vital as when it began and as bright a beacon of hope for all the world Let us go forward from here confident in hope strong in our faith in one another sustained by our faith in God who created us and striving always to serve His purpose",1973,"republican",12
"Richard Nixon","Senator Dirksen Mr Chief Justice Mr Vice president President Johnson Vice president Humphrey my fellow Americans and my fellow citizens of the world community I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment In the orderly transfer of power we celebrate the unity that keeps us free Each moment in history is a fleeting time precious and unique But some stand out as moments of beginning in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries This can be such a moment Forces now are converging that make possible for the first time the hope that many of man s deepest aspirations can at last be realized The spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate within our own lifetime advances that once would have taken centuries In throwing wide the horizons of space we have discovered new horizons on earth For the first time because the people of the world want peace and the leaders of the world are afraid of war the times are on the side of peace Eight years from now America will celebrate its th anniversary as a nation Within the lifetime of most people now living mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years the beginning of the third millennium What kind of a nation we will be what kind of a world we will live in whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes is ours to determine by our actions and our choices The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker This honor now beckons America the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization If we succeed generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment that we helped make the world safe for mankind This is our summons to greatness I believe the American people are ready to answer this call The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement We have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture We have shared our wealth more broadly than ever We have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth We have given freedom new reach We have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today I know America s youth I believe in them We can be proud that they are better educated more committed more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society or so possessed of the will to achieve it And because our strengths are so great we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope Standing in this same place a third of a century ago Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear He could say in surveying the Nation s troubles They concern thank God only material things Our crisis today is in reverse We find ourselves rich in goods but ragged in spirit reaching with magnificent precision for the moon but failing into raucous discord on earth We are caught in war wanting peace We are torn by division wanting unity We see around us empty lives wanting fulfillment We see tasks that need doing waiting for hands to do them To a crisis of the spirit we need an answer of the spirit And to find that answer we need only look within ourselves When we listen to the better angels of our nature we find that they celebrate the simple things the basic things such as goodness decency love kindness Greatness comes in simple trappings The simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us and cement what unites us To lower our voices would be a simple thing In these difficult years America has suffered from a fever of words from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices For its part government will listen We will strive to listen in new ways to the voices of quiet anguish the voices that speak without words the voices of the heart to the injured voices the anxious voices the voices that have despaired of being heard Those who have been left out we will try to bring in Those left behind we will help to catch up For all of our people we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure As we reach toward our hopes our task is to build on what has gone before not turning away from the old but turning toward the new In this past third of a century government has passed more laws spent more money initiated more programs than in all our previous history In pursuing our goals of full employment better housing excellence in education in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life in all these and more we will and must press urgently forward We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed What has to be done has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing with the people we can do everything To match the magnitude of our tasks we need the energies of our people enlisted not only in grand enterprises but more importantly in those small splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal With these we can build a great cathedral of the spirit each of us raising it one stone at a time as he reaches out to his neighbor helping caring doing I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice I ask you to join in a high adventure one as rich as humanity itself and exciting as the times we live in The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself no man is truly whole The way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents We achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use As we measure what can be done we shall promise only what we know we can produce but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not To go forward at all is to go forward together This means black and white together as one nation not two The laws have caught up with our conscience What remains is to give life to what is in the law to insure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before God all are born equal in dignity before man As we learn to go forward together at home let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind Let us take as our goal Where peace is unknown make it welcome where Peace is fragile make it strong where peace is temporary make it permanent After a period of confrontation we are entering an era of negotiation Let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open We seek an open world open to ideas open to the exchange of goods and people a world in which no people great or small will live in angry isolation We cannot expect to make everyone our friend but we can try to make no one our enemy Those who would be our adversaries we invite to a peaceful competition not in conquering territory or extending dominion but in enriching the life of man As we explore the reaches of space let us go to the new worlds together not as new worlds to be conquered but as a new adventure to be shared With those who are willing to join let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms to strengthen the structure of peace to lift up the poor and the hungry But to all those who would be tempted by weakness let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be Over the past years since I first came to this Capital as a freshman Congressman I have visited most of the nations of the world I have come to know the leaders of the world and the great forces the hatreds the fears that divide the world I know that peace does not come through wishing for it that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy I also know the people of the world I have seen the hunger of a homeless child the pain of a man wounded in battle the grief of a mother who has lost her son I know these have no ideology no race I know America I know the heart of America is good I speak from my own heart and the heart of my country the deep concern we have for those who suffer and those who sorrow I have taken an oath today in the presence of God and my countrymen to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States To that oath I now add this sacred commitment I shall consecrate my Office my energies and all the wisdom I can summon to the cause of peace among nations Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike The peace we seek the peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people but the peace that comes with healing in its wings with compassion for those who have suffered with understanding for those who have opposed us with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny Only a few short weeks ago we shared the glory of man s first sight of the world as God sees it as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon s gray surface on Christmas Eve they spoke to us of the beauty of earth and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance we heard them invoke God s blessing on its goodness In that moment their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write To see the earth as it truly is small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold brothers who know now they are truly brothers In that moment of surpassing technological triumph men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity seeing in that far perspective that man s destiny on earth is not divisible telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos our destiny lies not in the stars but on earth itself in our own hands in our own hearts We have endured a long night of the American spirit But as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn let us not curse the remaining dark Let us gather the light Our destiny offers not the cup of despair but the chalice of opportunity So let us seize it not in fear but in gladness and riders on the earth together let us go forward firm in our faith steadfast in our purpose cautious of the dangers but sustained by our confidence in the will of God and the promise of man",1969,"republican",13
"Lyndon B. Johnson","My fellow countrymen On this occasion the oath I have taken before you and before God is not mine alone but ours together We are one nation and one people Our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen but upon all citizens That is the majesty and the meaning of this moment For every generation there is a destiny For some history decides For this generation the choice must be our own Even now a rocket moves toward Mars It reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children or even for ourselves in a short span of years The next man to stand here will look out on a scene that is different from our own Ours is a time of change rapid and fantastic change bearing the secrets of nature multiplying the nations placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction shaking old values and uprooting old ways Our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people and on their faith THE AMERICAN COVENANT They came here the exile and the stranger brave but frightened to find a place where a man could be his own man They made a covenant with this land Conceived in justice written in liberty bound in union it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind And it binds us still If we keep its terms we shall flourish JUSTICE AND CHANGE First justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share in the fruits of the land In a land of great wealth families must not live in hopeless poverty In a land rich in harvest children just must not go hungry In a land of healing miracles neighbors must not suffer and die untended In a great land of learning and scholars young people must be taught to read and write For more than years that I have served this Nation I have believed that this injustice to our people this waste of our resources was our real enemy For years or more with the resources I have had I have vigilantly fought against it I have learned and I know that it will not surrender easily But change has given us new weapons Before this generation of Americans is finished this enemy will not only retreat it will be conquered Justice requires us to remember when any citizen denies his fellow saying His color is not mine or his beliefs are strange and different in that moment he betrays America though his forebears created this Nation LIBERTY AND CHANGE Liberty was the second article of our covenant It was self government It was our Bill of Rights But it was more America would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself stretching his talents rejoicing in his work important in the life of his neighbors and his nation This has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men We must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen THE WORLD AND CHANGE The American covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man And that is today our goal Thus if as a nation there is much outside our control as a people no stranger is outside our hope Change has brought new meaning to that old mission We can never again stand aside prideful in isolation Terrific dangers and troubles that we once called foreign now constantly live among us If American lives must end and American treasure be spilled in countries that we barely know then that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant Think of our world as it looks from that rocket that is heading toward Mars It is like a child s globe hanging in space the continent stuck to its side like colored maps We are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth And each of us in the span of time has really only a moment among our companions How incredible it is that in this fragile existence we should hate and destroy one another There are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature There is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way Our Nation s course is abundantly clear We aspire to nothing that belongs to others We seek no dominion over our fellow man but man s dominion over tyranny and misery But more is required Men want to be part of a common enterprise a cause greater than themselves And each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the Nation thus finding new purpose for ourselves Without this we will simply become a nation of strangers UNION AND CHANGE The third article is union To those who were small and few against the wilderness the success of liberty demanded the strength of union Two centuries of change have made this true again No longer need capitalist and worker farmer and clerk city and countryside struggle to divide our bounty By working shoulder to shoulder together we can increase the bounty of all We have discovered that every child who learns and every man who finds work and every sick body that is made whole like a candle added to an altar brightens the hope of all the faithful So let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and rekindle old hatreds They stand in the way of a seeking nation Let us now join reason to faith and action to experience to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose For the hour and the day and the time are here to achieve progress without strife to achieve change without hatred not without difference of opinion but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations THE AMERICAN BELIEF Under this covenant of justice liberty and union we have become a nation prosperous great and mighty And we have kept our freedom But we have no promise from God that our greatness will endure We have been allowed by Him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit I do not believe that the Great Society is the ordered changeless and sterile battalion of the ants It is the excitement of becoming always becoming trying probing falling resting and trying again but always trying and always gaining In each generation with toil and tears we have had to earn our heritage again If we fail now then we will have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship that democracy rests on faith that freedom asks more than it gives and the judgment of God is harshest on those who are most favored If we succeed it will not be because of what we have but it will be because of what we are not because of what we own but rather because of what we believe For we are a nation of believers Underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day s pursuits we are believers in justice and liberty and in our own union We believe that every man must some day be free And we believe in ourselves And that is the mistake that our enemies have always made In my lifetime in depression and in war they have awaited our defeat Each time from the secret places of the American heart came forth the faith that they could not see or that they could not even imagine And it brought us victory And it will again For this is what America is all about It is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge It is the star that is not reached and the harvest that is sleeping in the unplowed ground Is our world gone We say farewell Is a new world coming We welcome it and we will bend it to the hopes Of man And to these trusted public servants and to my family and those close friends of mine who have followed me down a long winding road and to all the people of this Union and the world I will repeat today what I said on that sorrowful day in November last year I will lead and I will do the best I can But you you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dreams They will lead you best of all For myself I ask only in the words of an ancient leader Give me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great",1965,"democratic",14
"John F. Kennedy","Vice President Johnson Mr Speaker Mr Chief Justice President Eisenhower Vice president Nixon President Truman Reverend Clergy fellow citizens We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom symbolizing an end as well as a beginning signifying renewal as well as change For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago The world is very different now For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution Let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and to which we are committed today at home and around the world Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty This much we pledge and more To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures Divided there is little we can do for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom and to remember that in the past those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves for whatever period is required not because the communists may be doing it not because we seek their votes but because it is right If a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich To our sister republics south of our border we offer a special pledge to convert our good words into good deeds in a new alliance for progress to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house To that world assembly of sovereign states the United Nations our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace we renew our pledge of support to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run Finally to those nations who would make themselves our adversary we offer not a pledge but a request that both sides begin anew the quest for peace before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self destruction We dare not tempt them with weakness For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind s final war So let us begin anew remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness and sincerity is always subject to proof Let us never negotiate out of fear But let us never fear to negotiate Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us Let both sides for the first time formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors Together let us explore the stars conquer the deserts eradicate disease tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah to undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free And if a beach head of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion let both sides join in creating a new endeavor not a new balance of power but a new world of law where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days nor in the life of this Administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet But let us begin In your hands my fellow citizens more than mine will rest the final success or failure of our course Since this country was founded each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe Now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not as a call to battle though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle year in and year out rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation a struggle against the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance North and South East and West that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind Will you join in that historic effort In the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger I do not shrink from this responsibility I welcome it I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation The energy the faith the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light the world And so my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country My fellow citizens of the world ask not what America will do for you but what together we can do for the freedom of man Finally whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you With a good conscience our only sure reward with history the final judge of our deeds let us go forth to lead the land we love asking His blessing and His help but knowing that here on earth God s work must truly be our own",1961,"democratic",15
